/**
 * <p>You do want the characters to improve over time and learn new skills,
 * right? That's where DBSClass comes in. A character learns moves from this
 * class. When a character levels up, (s)he gains a skill point, or SP, that
 * goes to the class. When a character has accumulated enough SP, (s)he learns
 * a move.</p>
 * <p>When a character reaches a certain threshold of SP, (s)he can progress a
 * level in that class. Going up a level means the opprotunity to learn more
 * powerful versions of previous moves as well as gaining a new Adrenaline
 * Rush. However, a move cannot be learned in a higher level until it is
 * learned in a lower level.</p>
 * <p>For example, Ronyo, a level one White Mage can learn Heal, Cure,
 * Fireworks, and Life. The Adrenaline Rush for level one is
 * Flash. For level two, Ronyo can learn Heal2, Protect, Trance, and Life2,
 * with the Adrenaline being Pierce. However, Ronyo can't learn Life2 until
 * he's learned Life, or for that matter, he can't learn Protect until he's
 * learned Cure. In order to get to the high-powered moves, he must go back
 * to level one and learn the basic versions.</p>
